description: A standard approach to building great software (hopefully)
---

There are as many opinions, languages and frameworks as there are ~~Javascript libraries~~
opinions on how to develop great software. This is a community-driven effort to create a standard approach
to building great software.

## Why?

On a daily basis, we all have to deal with the same problems. We all have to build software that
meets the needs of our users, our clients, our companies - but most importantly for us as developers:
software that we can trust, and software we enjoy creating!

Pagination, error handling, authentication, _TIME FORMATING!_ (sorry), code structure; these are concepts we work with every day,
and make new decisions and opinions about every day.

So what if there was a standard approach to building great software? What if we could all agree on how to build great software?

What if next time you had to integrate with a new API, you didn't have to unravel [Approach #52259](/reference/terminology#approach-52259)?

Well, let's give it a go!

## What is a Conventional Dev?

We love [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/), so we have shamelessly chosen the word `Conventional`
to represant a (mostly) harmless standard.

Once you've read through this document, we hope you'll feel a little more empowered to approach your daily problems,
and you can go ahead and call yourself a:

With that said, let's get started!
